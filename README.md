This browser extension searches your Plex server for matching media on sites like [IMDb](https://imdb.com), letting you immediately open the movie or TV show on Plex Web if it is available. If the item isn't found on your Plex server, then a download button is added instead.

Optionally you can configure Sonarr and/or Radarr in the extension's options. After that, you can immediately add a TV show or movie to Sonarr/Radarr with one click, right from your favorite site.
